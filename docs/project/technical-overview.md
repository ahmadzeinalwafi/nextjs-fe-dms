Node Sphere also adopts Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure that the software’s design reflects the business requirements and domain-specific concerns. By aligning the architecture with the core business processes, we create a model that accurately represents the real-world problems the platform aims to solve. DDD helps in breaking down complex domains into manageable pieces, with a focus on the rich interactions between entities, aggregates, and repositories. This approach enhances collaboration between technical and business teams, ensuring that the software solution aligns with evolving business needs.

In addition to Clean Architecture and DDD, the system adheres to the SOLID principles, which are key to creating high-quality, maintainable software. SOLID ensures that the system’s components are modular, scalable, and easy to extend. For example, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ensures that each component has one job, making the codebase easier to test and modify. The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ensures that we can add new features without modifying existing code, and Dependency Inversion (DIP) allows the system to be more flexible by decoupling components. Applying these principles ensures that Node Sphere is robust and prepared for future growth.

By combining Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, and SOLID principles, Node Sphere’s codebase remains flexible, secure, and easy to maintain.

The result is a system that is both high-performing and resilient to the demands of an evolving IoT ecosystem.

## System Architecture
Node Sphere’s system architecture is built on a 3-Tier Architecture, which separates the application into three distinct layers: the Frontend (FE), Backend (BE), and Database (DB). This separation allows for a cleaner, more manageable structure where each tier can be independently scaled or modified without affecting the others. The Frontend layer is responsible for the user interface, which allows users to interact with the platform, manage their IoT devices, and view analytics. The Backend handles business logic and API communication, processing requests from the Frontend and interacting with the Database layer to retrieve and store information. The Database stores all data, including device status, historical logs, and user information.

The system leverages an MQTT server as a worker for client communication, which enables efficient, low-overhead messaging between IoT devices and the Node Sphere platform. MQTT is an ideal choice for real-time communication due to its lightweight nature and publish-subscribe model, allowing devices to send and receive messages with minimal bandwidth. Additionally, AMPQ is used for handling scheduled messages, specifically for alert notifications, which ensures that critical updates are sent to users in a timely manner, such as system anomalies or device failures. The integration of these messaging protocols enables seamless, real-time monitoring and management of IoT devices across the platform.

The system architecture also enables scalability and flexibility by using these messaging systems to decouple components, allowing them to scale independently. This approach allows Node Sphere to efficiently handle growing numbers of connected devices while maintaining performance and reliability. The architecture's design also ensures that components can be added or updated without major disruption to the overall system, ensuring long-term adaptability to evolving business needs.

## Technologies
The technical stack of Node Sphere is carefully selected to provide the best performance, scalability, and flexibility. The system utilizes Mosquitto for MQTT messaging, a robust and lightweight broker that enables real-time communication between IoT devices. Mosquitto’s support for the MQTT protocol makes it an ideal choice for handling the communication needs of a large-scale IoT system, ensuring that messages are delivered reliably even in bandwidth-constrained environments.

For AMPQ messaging, Node Sphere uses RabbitMQ, a widely adopted messaging broker known for its reliability and support for complex routing mechanisms. RabbitMQ is perfect for handling scheduled alerts and system notifications, ensuring that critical information is delivered to users in a timely manner. With its powerful features for message queuing and distribution, RabbitMQ helps ensure that alerts are handled efficiently without overloading the system.

The Backend of Node Sphere is built using the net/http package from Go (Golang), which provides a fast, efficient, and reliable framework for handling HTTP requests and serving RESTful APIs. This package ensures that the system can scale effectively and handle high throughput with low latency, which is critical for IoT applications that require real-time responsiveness. For the Frontend, Node Sphere utilizes Next.js, a powerful React framework, combined with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for modern, responsive design. This stack ensures that users have a seamless experience when interacting with the platform, whether on desktop or mobile devices.

The combination of these technologies provides a solid foundation for building a performant, scalable, and secure IoT platform. Each technology is carefully chosen to meet the specific demands of Node Sphere’s architecture, ensuring that the platform can grow with the needs of the business while maintaining high standards of reliability and performance.

## Deployment Platform
Node Sphere will initially be deployed as a single-instance, self-hosted solution, which makes it easy for organizations to set up the system on their own infrastructure. This deployment model is ideal for businesses looking to maintain control over their IoT data and operations without relying on third-party services. To ensure accessibility and secure remote access, Cloudflare tunneling will be used to expose the system to the internet safely. Cloudflare provides a robust solution for protecting the platform from external threats and enables seamless access to the Node Sphere platform from any location while maintaining security and performance.

While the system will begin with a Docker-based prototype for easy configuration and testing, the long-term plan is to migrate to Kubernetes for greater reliability and scalability. Kubernetes will provide the ability to orchestrate containers across clusters, enabling automatic scaling, failover, and management of resources. This transition to Kubernetes will ensure that Node Sphere can handle larger, more complex deployments with minimal overhead, allowing businesses to easily scale their IoT operations as needed. Kubernetes also provides enhanced automation for deployments, rollbacks, and updates, ensuring that the platform remains up-to-date and highly available.

The flexibility of Docker and Kubernetes makes Node Sphere well-suited for deployment in a variety of environments, whether on-premises or in the cloud. By adopting a cloud-native architecture, the system can take advantage of the full power of containerization and orchestration, ensuring that Node Sphere remains resilient, reliable, and easy to manage at scale. As businesses continue to expand their IoT networks, the transition to Kubernetes will provide the reliability and flexibility needed to meet growing demands.

## Security

Security is a top priority for Node Sphere, and its approach begins with using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and verification. JWT allows for secure, stateless communication between the client and the backend, ensuring that users’ identities are verified before they can access the system. This method of authentication is lightweight and scalable, making it ideal for handling the needs of large IoT networks with many devices and users.

For password management, Node Sphere uses Argon2, a cryptographic hashing algorithm that was chosen as the winner of the password hashing competition due to its resistance to various types of attacks, such as brute-force and side-channel attacks. Argon2’s memory-hard approach ensures that password hashes are computationally expensive to compute, making it difficult for attackers to crack passwords even if they gain access to the hashed data. This provides an additional layer of security for users’ credentials.

Looking ahead, Node Sphere plans to enhance its security by implementing session-based authentication for even stronger user verification. Sessions allow for more fine-grained control over user access and can provide better protection against certain types of attacks, such as session hijacking. Additionally, encryption will be integrated into data delivery to ensure that all communication between devices, clients, and the backend is protected against interception or tampering. This multi-layered security approach ensures that Node Sphere remains a secure and trusted platform for managing IoT devices and data.

By adopting best practices in security and staying ahead of emerging threats, Node Sphere provides a reliable and secure solution for businesses that require IoT management at scale. The combination of JWT, Argon2, session management, and encryption offers a robust security posture that protects both user data and IoT device communications.
